# CryptoPals

My ongoing work in progress to complete the various [CryptoPals](http://cryptopals.com/) challenges. Implementations will make attempts in various languages for parity and practice.

## PHP

The PHP version requires:
- `mcrypt` support (`brew install php-mcrypt`)
- `gmp` support (`brew install php-gmp`)
